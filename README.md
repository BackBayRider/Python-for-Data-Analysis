# Introduction to Python

This 1-day workshop is designed with beginners, especially those without any Python or prorgamming background, in mind. 

The workshop starts with a gentle introduction to programming with Python covering the essentials, [Python Essentials](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/anthonyng2/Intro-to-Python-Algo-Trading-/blob/master/Python%20Essentials.ipynb), such as the Python environment, data types, variables, operators, object oriented programming, and function. Other aspects of programming including flow control, looping techniques and functional programming are also covered under the topic of [Flow Control & Functional Programming](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/anthonyng2/Intro-to-Python-Algo-Trading-/blob/master/Flow%20Control%20%26%20Functional%20Programming.ipynb). The participants are also introduced to the excellent Pandas library, [Pandas Essentials](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/anthonyng2/Intro-to-Python-Algo-Trading-/blob/master/Pandas%20Essentials.ipynb), covering data structure, how to get started, data loading, wrangling, plotting and many many more.

# Algorithmic Trading

The afternoon session is spent on introducing the workshop participants to the Quantopian Integrated Development Envinroment (IDE) and getting them to start writing simple codes. The course materials for the afternoon session can be found [here](https://www.quantopian.com/tutorials/getting-started).
